		<p class="pDesc">
			This project was made during the McGill Physics Hackathon.<br>
			Due to the limited time in the event, the GUI wasn't the main priority.<br>
			There are two main parts.<br>First is the GUI with the circuit builder. 
			This part is used to show the dfferent gates and the different states at the different stages of the circuit.<br>
			The second part is a proof of concept for the Shor's algorithm. This is only a TUI and has very limited capabilities due to the nature of Shor's algorithm.
			It can handle at most a product of primes as big as 21. It will then use properties of quantum computers to find the products.
